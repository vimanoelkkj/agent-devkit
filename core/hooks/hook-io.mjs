/**
 * Shared stdin/JSON parsing for hook scripts. Every hook should read its
 * event via `parseHookEvent(readStdinRaw())` instead of hand-rolling
 * `JSON.parse(readStdin() || "{}")` locally — that idiom does not guard
 * against a literal JSON `null` on stdin (valid JSON, parses without
 * throwing), which then crashes the first unguarded `event.x` property
 * access with an uncaught TypeError (exit 1, stack to stderr) instead of
 * failing open. `typeof event.x` does NOT protect against this either —
 * the property access happens before `typeof` sees the result.
 *
 * Not a hook itself — a shared helper other hooks `import` by relative
 * path, same pattern as session-scratch.mjs. Deliberately dependency-free
 * (no vault/worktree/tool-specific imports) so every hook can use it
 * regardless of which pillar installed it.
