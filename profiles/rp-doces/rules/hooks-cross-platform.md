# Hooks — cross-platform `.mjs` standard

## Objective

Every hook must run identically on macOS, Linux, and Windows (native and WSL)
with zero platform-specific wrappers. **Every hook is authored as `.mjs` and
invoked through Node's exec form. No exceptions, no conditional fallbacks.**
Node.js is the only runtime guaranteed reachable across all platforms, so it is
the single allowed hook runtime.

## Runtime decision

`.mjs` + `node` is the **only** accepted hook runtime here. The rows below are
**why every alternative is rejected**, not when they may be used — never read a
condition (`only if`, `ok with`) as permission to ship a non-`.mjs` hook.

```
.mjs + node  →  cross-platform standard. ALWAYS use. Only allowed runtime.
.sh          →  rejected. Breaks on native Windows (needs WSL/Git Bash).
python       →  rejected. python3 path traps on Windows; needs UV; extra dep.
PowerShell   →  rejected. Windows-only.
Go/Rust bin  →  not for hooks. Use only for distributed CLIs.
```

## Mandatory rules

- Write **every** hook as `.mjs` (Node ESM). No exceptions — never `.js`, `.ts`, `.sh`, `.bat`, or `.ps1`, regardless of stack, platform, or perceived convenience.
- If you are tempted to author a hook in any other runtime, stop and rewrite it as `.mjs` before continuing.
- Wire hooks in `settings.json` using **exec form** (`command: "node"` + `args`), never shell form.
- Reference the hook script through the `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR` env var so it resolves from any working directory.
- Read JSON from stdin, write JSON to stdout, exit with `0` or `2` only — every other exit code is a bug.
- Use `os.homedir()` and `path.join()` for every path and home-directory reference.
- **For session-transient state a hook writes and later reads back (flag files, dedup markers, per-session caches): use `sessionScratchDir(sessionId)` from `.claude/hooks/session-scratch.mjs`, never raw `os.tmpdir()`.** A raw `os.tmpdir()` write falls outside Claude Code's pre-authorized per-session scratchpad and can trigger a mid-session permission prompt; worse, if the state is keyed by a project-directory hash instead of the session id, **parallel sessions of the same project silently share the file** — see `.claude/rules/hooks-cwd-resolution.md`'s Purpose B section for the concrete bug this causes. `sessionScratchDir()` is permission-free (it resolves inside Claude Code's own scratchpad) and inherently unique per session — no hash needed.
- Raw `os.tmpdir()` remains correct only for state that is deliberately **not** session-scoped and whose cross-session/cross-process sharing is harmless or desired — e.g. a content-addressed cache of external, non-project-specific data, or an intentional single global lock serializing unrelated background work. Any such use must carry a comment explaining why it is safe to share.
- **Narrow exception — read-only discovery of Claude Code's own scratchpad:** `.claude/hooks/session-scratch.mjs` searches `os.tmpdir()` and the literal `"/tmp"` for Claude Code's pre-existing per-session scratchpad directory (never a location this hook creates or writes to directly). The literal is required because macOS's `os.tmpdir()` returns a per-process `$TMPDIR` under `/var/folders/...` — a Darwin-specific redirection — which does NOT match Claude Code's actual scratchpad root (`/private/tmp/claude-<uid>/...`); `/tmp` is a stable symlink to `/private/tmp` on macOS, so searching it (never writing to it) finds the real location. Harmless no-op elsewhere: on Linux `/tmp` typically equals `os.tmpdir()` already (redundant scan); on Windows it resolves to a nonexistent path and fails closed via the existing try/catch. This exception is scoped to that one search list in that one file — it does not license any other file to hardcode a temp path as a write target.
- **Parse a hook's stdin via `parseHookEvent(readStdinRaw())` from `.claude/hooks/hook-io.mjs`, never hand-roll `JSON.parse(readStdin() || "{}")` locally.** That idiom does not guard against a literal JSON `null` on stdin — `null` is valid JSON and parses without throwing, so the first unguarded `event.x` property access afterward throws an uncaught `TypeError` (exit 1, stack to stderr) instead of the documented `0`/`2` exit contract. `typeof event.x` does **not** protect against this either — the property access happens before `typeof` sees the result. `parseHookEvent` returns `null` for that case (and for genuinely malformed JSON); the caller decides whether to `process.exit(0)` immediately or fall back to `?? {}` and continue with an empty event.
- **MANDATORY** — every `spawn` / `exec` / `execFile` / `fork` call inside a hook **must** pass `windowsHide: true` in its options. Issue [#19012](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/19012): without it, spawning Node.js (or any console app) flashes a console window on Windows. The option is a no-op on macOS/Linux, so always set it — no condition.
- To run an npm-installed tool (eslint, prettier, tsc) from a hook on Windows, invoke its JS entrypoint directly via `node`, never the `node_modules/.bin` shim.

## Windows API traps (each verified on real Windows CI, each cost a shipped bug)

- **`fs.realpathSync` is NOT `GetFinalPathNameByHandleW`** — it is Node's JS reimplementation
  of POSIX realpath and resolves symlinks only, so on Windows it returns 8.3 short names
  (`RUNNER~1`) unchanged, while git and most tooling record long names. A strict comparison
  then silently fails. Use **`fs.realpathSync.native`** (libuv `uv_fs_realpath`) on BOTH
  operands of any path equality check.
- **`.bat`/`.cmd` cannot be spawned without a shell**, even fully-qualified — `CreateProcess`
  needs a real executable image. Composer, npm and many package managers ship `.bat` shims.
  When a shell is unavoidable, allow-list untrusted args _before_ they reach it; quoting alone
  is not sufficient (CVE-2024-27980).
- **Git for Windows creates `.git` hidden** (`core.hideDotFiles`), including a linked
  worktree's pointer file. `writeFileSync`'s default `'w'` maps to `CREATE_ALWAYS`, which
  Win32 refuses on a hidden file with a **permanent** `EPERM` — retrying never clears it. Use
  `openSync(path, "r+")` + `ftruncateSync`.
- **A live process's cwd is locked** — `rmSync` on a directory a detached child is running in
  fails `EPERM`. Test teardown needs a retry helper, not a bare `rmSync`.
- **`cmd.exe` reports a missing command as exit 1 + "is not recognized"**, never POSIX exit 127. Any fail-open "binary absent" check must match both, or the hook blocks forever on
  Windows.

## Forbidden

- Don't author a hook in anything but `.mjs` — no `.sh`, `.bat`, `.ps1`, `.py`, or any platform-specific shell, under any condition.
- Don't use shell form (`command: "node \"...\""`) — quoting and shell availability break on Windows.
- Don't hardcode `$HOME` / `%USERPROFILE%`, `/tmp` / `$env:TEMP`, or `/` / `\\` path separators — except the one documented, read-only search-candidate exception in `session-scratch.mjs` above (never for a write target).
- Don't ship a Python hook at all — App Execution Alias stubs shadow `python.exe`/`python3.exe` on stock Windows and redirect to the Microsoft Store. (Python's `python` vs `python3` split and UV dependency are extra reasons; the rule is simply: rewrite it as `.mjs`.)
- Don't reference `npm`, `npx`, `eslint`, or any `.cmd`/`.bat` shim as the exec-form `command` — those are not real executables and can't be spawned without a shell.
- Don't assume `jq`. Parse JSON in Node, not with an external binary.
- Don't return more than one decision field or emit malformed `hookSpecificOutput` — a bad schema fails silently in production.

## Portability patterns inside the `.mjs`

```js
import os from "node:os";
import path from "node:path";

// ✅ Cross-platform
const home = os.homedir(); // instead of $HOME / %USERPROFILE%
const tmp = os.tmpdir(); // instead of /tmp / $env:TEMP
const p = path.join(home, ".config"); // instead of hardcoded / or \\
```

Spawning a child process — `windowsHide: true` is **mandatory**, always:

```js
import { spawn } from "node:child_process";

// ✅ windowsHide prevents the Windows console flash (issue #19012); no-op on macOS/Linux
const child = spawn("node", [scriptPath], { windowsHide: true });
```

## Wiring in settings.json

Exec form — **use this** (cross-platform safe, no shell):

```json
{ "command": "node", "args": ["${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}/.claude/hooks/hook.mjs"] }
```

Shell form — **do not use** (Windows breaks on quoting / missing shell):

```json
{ "command": "node \"$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/.claude/hooks/hook.mjs\"" }
```

Running an npm tool from a hook on Windows — invoke the JS entrypoint, not the shim:

```json
{
  "command": "node",
  "args": ["${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/node_modules/eslint/bin/eslint.js", "--fix", "."]
}
```

## What Anthropic officially says

The hook API is **language-agnostic** — anything that reads JSON from stdin,
writes JSON to stdout, and exits with the correct code (`0`, `2`) works. Official
examples default to bash, and the docs ship **no cross-platform guidance** (the
only alternative-runtime mention is a one-line jq-fallback tip). Treat the
`.mjs` exec-form standard above as this project's portability layer over that gap.

Default shell per platform when shell form is used (`"command": "bash script.sh"`):

| Platform    | Default shell                                  |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| macOS/Linux | `sh -c`                                        |
| Windows     | Git Bash (or PowerShell if Git Bash is absent) |

A `"shell"` field can force PowerShell on Windows — Windows-only, avoid:

```json
{ "type": "command", "command": "script.ps1", "shell": "powershell" }
```

## Caveats

- **Node is not bundled on every platform.** The 2025 native Windows installer dropped the bundled Node.js runtime, so `node` in a hook depends on the user having Node installed. It remains the most reliable target, but it is not unconditionally guaranteed.
- **Windows console flash.** Issue [#19012](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/19012) — hooks flash a console window when spawning Node.js on Windows. Closed as not planned. The fix (`windowsHide: true` on every internal spawn) is **mandatory**, not optional — see the Mandatory rules. The flash is cosmetic and does not affect behavior, but the option is required on every spawn regardless.

## Acceptance criteria

- The hook is `.mjs` and wired via exec form (`node` + `args`) with `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR`.
- No `.sh`/`.bat`/`.ps1`, no shell form, no hardcoded paths, home, or temp, except the one documented search-candidate exception in `session-scratch.mjs` (read-only discovery, never a write target).
- All other path/home access goes through `path.join` / `os.homedir`; session-transient temp state goes through `sessionScratchDir()`, not raw `os.tmpdir()` (narrow exceptions per Mandatory rules).
- Every `spawn`/`exec`/`execFile`/`fork` call passes `windowsHide: true`.
